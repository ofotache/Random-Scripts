Fix Transmission Service kernel parameter issue for UDP buffers

When we check the status of the service we can see the the following warning:

Feb 10 12:51:45 banana transmission-daemon[11901]: [2019-02-10 12:51:45.105] UDP Failed to set receive buffer: requested 4194304, got 425984 (tr-udp.c:84)
Feb 10 12:51:45 banana transmission-daemon[11901]: [2019-02-10 12:51:45.105] UDP Failed to set send buffer: requested 1048576, got 425984 (tr-udp.c:95)

Below we have the action plan for the fix:

# Check the requested buffer values
systemctl status transmission

# Stop service
systemctl stop transmission

# Check existing values
cat /etc/sysctl.conf

# Add UDP receive buffer
echo 'net.core.wmem_max = 4194304' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
# Add UDP send buffer
echo 'net.core.rmem_max = 1048576' >> /etc/sysctl.conf

# Refresh the new Kernel tuning configuration
sysctl -p

systemctl start transmission
systemctl status transmission
# This fixes the issue
