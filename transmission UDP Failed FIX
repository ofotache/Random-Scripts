Fix Transmission Service kernel parameter issue for UDP buffers

When we check the status of the service we can see the the following warning:

Feb 10 12:51:45 banana transmission-daemon[11901]: [2019-02-10 12:51:45.105] UDP Failed to set receive buffer: requested 4194304, got 425984 (tr-udp.c:84)
Feb 10 12:51:45 banana transmission-daemon[11901]: [2019-02-10 12:51:45.105] UDP Failed to set send buffer: requested 1048576, got 425984 (tr-udp.c:95)

Below we have the action plan for the fix:

# Check the requested buffer values
systemctl status transmission

# Check existing Kernel tuning values
cat /etc/sysctl.conf

# Check for service individual file (transmission)
ls -l /etc/sysctl.d | grep trans
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 56 Feb 10 14:24 transmission.conf

# Check the actual configuration
# If file is not available, it will be created at next steps
cat /etc/sysctl.d/transmission.conf

# We also check the default values of the system
sysctl -a | grep net.core.rmem_
sysctl -a | grep net.core.wmem_

# If the default values for max value are too small,
# we can change them as follows (15MB buffer RX and TX)
# Example for 10MB
# 10 * 1024 * 1024 = 10485760 (bytes)
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=15728640
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=15728640

# Now we set the max values for transmission (10MB)
# Add UDP receive buffer
echo 'net.core.wmem_max =10485760' >> /etc/sysctl.d/transmission.conf
# Add UDP send buffer
echo 'net.core.rmem_max =10485760' >> /etc/sysctl.d/transmission.conf

# Refresh the new Kernel tuning configuration
sysctl -p

systemctl reload transmission && systemctl status transmission
# This fixes the issue
